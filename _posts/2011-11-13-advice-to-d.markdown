title: Advice to a struggling writer
---

**David**: ok check out this exercise i just made up  
**David**: make a list or a mind map or whatever  
**David**: and at the top/center, write "Life would be easier if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"  
**David**: and then just make a list of as many things as you can think of  
**David**: brainstorm, so don't throw anything out  
**David**: then group things together categorically, groups can be as small or large as you want  
**David**: but try to have like multiple groupings, so no fair just being like "life would be easier if everything was perfect"  
**David**: then, think of root causes for the groups  
**David**: like how does a person "make more money" or whatever  
**David**: god this sounds stupid written down  
**David**: and maybe it will look like every 5 year plan ever  
**David**: but i know for a fact that if you think a situation is a dead end it is easy as shit to see that dead end coming and fear that dead end and just like lose your mind to that dead end  
**David**: and i don't care how many times you wake up to the same thing  
**David**: we all fucking wake up to the same thing every day  
**David**: numbing sameness  
**David**: because change happens slowly  
**David**: basically nobody wins the lottery and the people who do aren't measurably happier  
**David**: they're just louder  
**David**: and maybe it's easy for me to say this shit because i'm in the eye of the storm right now and tomorrow i'll just go back to eating shit for breakfast lunch and dinner and i'll stop washing my clothes because who cares and then after that i'll just quit my job and lay on my couch all day watching netflix until they shut off the power but word on the street is anything besides that is normal and every man loses his life to the proverbial 9 - 5 and spends his weekends cooking for himself and washing his button front and black pants and then starts over again on monday that's the fucking trick
