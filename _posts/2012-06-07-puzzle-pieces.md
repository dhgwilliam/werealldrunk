I am sad and I can't explain why he said  
You don't know? she said

No I don't he said as tears formed in his eyes.

She was silent as only one who knows can be silent.

Why can't I find my matching puzzle piece? he said  
Because you don't know your own shape she said

I know who I am not he said  
But a puzzle piece doesn't have only edges she said

A puzzle piece fills a hole he said  
But the hole must be empty in the first place she said

It's not a hole unless I belong in it he said  
How do you know you belong there she said

Because I feel deep inside of me that there is a place where I fit in he said  
How is that any different from any other missing puzzle piece she said

My feelings are real he said More real than the feelings of any other puzzle piece he said  
What makes you think you're so special she said

Nobody else's feelings feel like this he said  
You're one in a million puzzle pieces she said

I've done the research he said  
You never asked me she said
